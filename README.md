# Cancer-Classification-Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle.
Different Classification Algorithms have been applied on the dataset to check the accuracy scores.
    Algorithm---------------------------Accuracy Score           
  1) Logistic Regression----------------0.96
  2) K nearest Neighbours---------------0.95
  3) Support Vector Machine-------------0.98
  4) Kernel SVM-------------------------0.98
  5) Naive Bayes------------------------0.90
  6) Random Forest Classification-------0.97
Support Vector Machine and Kernel SVM algorithms give same accuracy score. However, Kernel SVM gives false negative to 2 people and SVM gives false negative to 1 person. With such a deadly disease, the number of False negative should be reduced as much as possible. Hence, SVM proves to be the best model.
